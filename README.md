##  Hey there everyone <img src="wave.gif" width="22px">

I am a designer at heart. I love developing human experiences that delight people. Helping others is what makes me tick. For me, software is just a means to an end.

I am good at understanding technology. I love learning new technologies because that enables me to develop the best solution across a wide range of domains. I love to make the complicated simple for everyone.

I believe that a real leader goes beyond being a "team lead" or a "fellow employee". A real leader understands and cares for his team on a personal level, knows their strengths and weaknesses and strives to empower them to become the best version of themselves. ‚ù§Ô∏è
